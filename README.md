##  Paddy Disease Detection and Classification

This project focuses on automating the identification of diseases in paddy crops using computer vision techniques. Paddy (Oryza sativa), a staple food worldwide, is predominantly cultivated in tropical climates, particularly in Asia. However, paddy cultivation is highly susceptible to diseases and pests, which can cause yield losses of up to 70%. Effective disease management requires expert supervision, but the limited availability of crop protection experts makes manual diagnosis both time-consuming and expensive.

To address this challenge, this project leverages a dataset of labeled paddy leaf images to develop an AI-driven disease classification model. By automating the disease detection process, we aim to provide an efficient, cost-effective solution for paddy farmers to safeguard their crops.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset contains a total of 13,876 labeled paddy leaf images divided into two parts:

Training Set: 10,407 images (75%), labeled across ten categories:
Nine disease types
Normal (healthy) leaf
Test Set: 3,469 images (25%) for model evaluation.
Metadata Included
Each image is accompanied by additional metadata to enhance model accuracy:

Paddy Variety: The type of paddy.
Age: The age of the paddy in days.
