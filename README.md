## Introduction
 
In modern agriculture, the early detection and management of plant diseases are vital for safeguarding crop health and ensuring food security. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through Azure AI's Custom Vision service, offers farmers and agronomists a cutting-edge solution to identify and control plant diseases with unprecedented efficiency.

### Development
 
Azure AI Custom Vision is a sophisticated cognitive service designed to enable the creation of custom image classifiers using machine learning technology. Its comprehensive feature set and user-friendly interface make it particularly effective for applications such as plant disease classification.

### Data Collection
 
The initial step in developing a classifier model involves gathering a comprehensive dataset of plant images. This dataset should encompass a wide range of plants, both healthy and diseased, captured under varying conditions and stages of infection. For this project, we sourced images from Kaggle, which you can download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset).

### Data Tagging
 
Once the dataset is assembled, each image must be accurately tagged with labels indicating the plant's health status or the specific type of disease present. This critical step forms the foundation for training the AI model. Fortunately, the images obtained from Kaggle are pre-tagged by folder, and there are separate images available for training, validation, and testing purposes.


## Example from Kaggle
###  Paddy Disease Detection and Classification

This project focuses on automating the identification of diseases in paddy crops using computer vision techniques. Paddy (Oryza sativa), a staple food worldwide, is predominantly cultivated in tropical climates, particularly in Asia. However, paddy cultivation is highly susceptible to diseases and pests, which can cause yield losses of up to `70%`. Effective disease management requires expert supervision, but the limited availability of crop protection experts makes manual diagnosis both time-consuming and expensive.

To address this challenge, this project leverages a dataset of labeled paddy leaf images to develop an AI-driven disease classification model. By automating the disease detection process, we aim to provide an efficient, cost-effective solution for paddy farmers to safeguard their crops.


### Dataset Overview
The dataset contains a total of `13,876` labeled paddy leaf images divided into two parts:

Training Set: `10,407` images `(75%)`, labeled across ten categories:
Nine disease types
Normal (healthy) leaf
Test Set: `3,469` images `(25%)` for model evaluation.
Metadata Included
Each image is accompanied by additional metadata to enhance model accuracy:

Paddy Variety: The type of paddy.
Age: The age of the paddy in days.
